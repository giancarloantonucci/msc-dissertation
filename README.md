This repository complements my dissertation "Iterative solution of evolutionary PDEs via all-at-once methods" with Prof Andrew Wathen, submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. Contained in this repository are two components of the solver - `pminres.m` and `fftsolve.m` - as well as numerical simulations for the heat equation. Use `plot_settings.m` for better plotting outputs.
